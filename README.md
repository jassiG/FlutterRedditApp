# FlutterRedditApp
__My first cross platform application using Flutter.__
___
This App takes Reddit memes from r/dankmemes/hot and r/memes/hot and shows them in a random order on press of a button.

currently it only shows the memes and does not interract with them, but I will add some other essential functionalities like Upvoting, Downvoting and Downloading the files.
