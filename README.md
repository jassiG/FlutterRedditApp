# FlutterRedditApp
__My first cross platform application using Flutter.__
___
This App takes Reddit memes from r/dankmemes/hot and r/memes/hot and shows them in a random order on press of a button.

Another added functionality in v0.0.2 is the r/all option. Now you can toggle between memes and popular posts by clicking the checkbox in the app drawer.

currently it only shows the memes and does not interract with them, but I will add some other essential functionalities like Upvoting, Downvoting and Downloading the files.
